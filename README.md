# ReworkedDiscordbot

Personal Discord bot with a number of random features that I felt like making. 
It uses discord.py and yt_dlp as its only external libraries all other libraries used are python built in libraries.
It makes api calls to Riot Games api, Datadragon a 3rd party api for Riots api to convert ids to names.
It also makes api calls to weather.gov.
It has an economy system.
